## Feature requests and feedbacks

We encourage you to [open a discussion](https://github.com/orgs/setten-io/discussions/new) if you have suggestions for how we can improve our products.
You don't need to have a solution to the problem you are facing to kick off a discussion.

Prior to making a new discussion, please take a look at previous discussions to see if someone else has already brought to our attention your suggestions.
If you find a similar discussion, reply with additional details or upvote the discussion to signal your support rather than creating a new discussion.

### From a suggestion to a shipped feature

Once you kick off a discussion, the Setten team will evaluate the feedback but will not be able to respond to every submission.

We will assess all the propositions, biased towards the most upvoted ones.

## Questions

Before posting please take a look at our [documentation](https://docs.setten.io).
There's a good chance the answer for what you're looking for is already in there.

Please also perform a quick search to see if someone already asked the same question.
If you find a similar one, the best way to make it visible is by upvoting it.
It's better to avoid comments without added context like "+1" or "I have the same problem".

Altough we're trying to get our documentation up to date and consolidate it based on the questions asked here, there might be some missing information.
